This project aims to combine mathematical epidemiology, pharmacokinetics, and machine learning to optimize disease prediction, diagnosis, and drug dosing strategies. The goal is to create a data-driven, multi-disciplinary approach to advance personalized medicine and improve patient outcomes.

Key areas of focus include:

Mathematical Epidemiology: Using classical SIR and SEIR models to simulate disease spread and predict outbreaks.

Pharmacokinetics: Calculating drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination to determine optimal dosages.

Machine Learning/AI: Using AI models to enhance diagnostic accuracy, predict disease progression, and optimize treatment plans.

This project integrates these areas into a seamless workflow, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and optimizing drug dosage for individual patients based on their unique characteristics.
